The purpose of this board is to be able to use a USB Type-C laptop charger to run one LV system (such as BPS or Controls). The dongle will act as a breakout; negotiating the power delivery at a fixed voltage with the laptop charger and delivering as much current as needed at a stable voltage of 12V/5V.

Currently under active development. Please reference the [USB-C PD Dongle Design Document](https://cloud.wikis.utexas.edu/wiki/spaces/LHRSOLAR/pages/28287742/2024+-+2026+USB-C+PD+Dongle+Design+Document) for more information.
